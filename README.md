## Utils

 <code>´__init__.py´</code> is a special Python file used to mark a directory as a Python package. It is executed when the package is imported and can be used to initialize the package or set up any necessary resources for the package. The file can be empty, but its presence in a directory indicates to Python that the directory should be considered a package and allows for other modules in the package to be imported and used.
